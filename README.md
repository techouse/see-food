Requires Xcode 9 to build and a physical device running iOS 11 (i.e. iPhone) to run.

Uses [Google's Inception v3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) model prepared for CoreML and downloaded from [Apple's developer website]((https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/run-a-model/) ).

### How to use
Open this project in Xcode 9 (or above) and build and deploy it to your physical device, open the app, tap on the camera button and take a pictue of a hotdog :blush:
